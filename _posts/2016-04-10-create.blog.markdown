## Welcome to My Blog

Dear guys, welcome to Liping Zhang's blog.

This blog is built by Jekyll.

## Liping Zhang's Blog

I was thinking about creating my blog for a long time, but due to busy projects on hands, I didn't had chance to do it. 

It's a good day today, since finally I can start to create my own blog on github now.

I Hope I can continue to contribute code and tech blog in github all the time, and hope it is a good way to track my growth. 


## Time is Valuable

Time is valuable, howeve time is easy to lose.  No matther how busy you are, please don't forget to recharge yourself.
